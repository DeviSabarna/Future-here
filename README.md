# Future-here
"Future here" uses machine learning to predict Tsunami in future.We use the dataset of previously occurred earthquakes and predict the future Tsunamis using suitable machine learning classifiers.This works well than manual method.This method reduces the manpower involved in monitoring and prediction.
